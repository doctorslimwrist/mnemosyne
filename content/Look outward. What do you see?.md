Imagine you are walking from the end of a very long pier, down to the shore.

From the end of the pier, you can't see any details in the buildings on the shore, nor make out any specific person as they walk. You can sweep your field of vision up and down the shore, but you're too far to make out details.

From a medium distance, you begin to be able to make out some distinct forms. Your eye can still pass over a wide portion of this panorama pretty quickly. But are you seeing *more*?

A short distance out, you begin to make out the shapes of the hotdog carts. Your eyes follow the shape of a cyclist down the beach. From here, you see in greater detail, but your viewing angle of the shore has narrowed.

When you step onto the shore, you see a woman with an easel and a set of watercolors. She's propped up a sign reading "$5 paintings, whatever you like." 

You decide to have her make a painting of the what the beach looks like. How do you describe it to her?

Do you describe in painstaking detail the exact faces and outfits of individual passersby? Do you try to put words to the colors and shapes of the coastline viewed from the pier?

[[Either might be appropriate]].
