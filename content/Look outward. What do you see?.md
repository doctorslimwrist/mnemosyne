Imagine you are walking from the end of a very long pier, down to the shore.

From the end of the pier, you can't see any details in the buildings on the shore, nor make out any specific person as they walk. You can sweep your field of vision up and down the shore, but you're too far to make out details.

From a medium distance, you begin to be able to make out some distinct forms. Your eye can still pass over a wide portion of this panorama pretty quickly. But are you seeing *more*?

A short distance out, you begin to make out the shapes of the hotdog carts. Your eyes follow the shape of a cyclist down the beach. From here, you see in greater detail, but your viewing angle of the shore has narrowed.

When you step onto the shore, you see a woman with an easel and a set of watercolors. She's propped up a sign reading "$5 paintings, whatever you like." 

You decide to have her make a painting of the what the beach looks like. How do you describe it to her?

Do you describe in painstaking detail the exact faces and outfits of individual passersby? Do you try to put words to the colors and shapes of the coastline viewed from the pier?

The human mind has one crucial limitation. It is a [[scanning system]]. It can only treat reality as an incoming stream of conscious attention that passes over the world in lines.

It has a center, which is detailed, and a periphery, which takes in more abstract information and forms. Together, what we call *vision* is just the sliver of the universe which happens to fall within that cone of eyesight at a given moment. 

But the world comes at us extremely quickly, with a flood of information coming in from every sense, in every direction, able to be digested with varying levels of ease. It is this fundamental limitation that gets in the way of our ability to navigate the world.

If only there was some way to slip out of relying on this [[scanning system]]...
