Borges wrote extensively of religious themes that he either hid behind the layers of his texts, or used directly as literary devices. For example, his short story [[The Zahir]], the story which prompted a life of love for him that has not lost its luster, he writes of a cursed object that consumes the attention of all who come across it. 

In Islamic theology, al-Zahir is one of the ninety-nine names of God, one which means "apparent" or "outward", the presence of God made manifest. The place at which God meets the physical world, which is everywhere and everything. Under some interpretations of Islamic theology, the physical universe and the metaphysical being-that-is are the other two sacred Qur'ans, in addition to the holy text that forms the basis of God's presence.
