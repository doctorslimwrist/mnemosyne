I like how in [[Borges]] short stories there's always an element of exploring the effect of supernatural phenomena when it runs up against the limits of human capability.

This is my documentation section in which I will be keeping an eye on what I am writing while I am writing it.
I like how this document has the characteristic where the text scrolls up with me as I'm writing, like the feed of a typewriter. Combined with the fact that when I slow down, the text fades away periodically, and if I stop too much, it completely disappears. I think I technically can undo it, but I think the spirit of the plugin is to force me to obey the rule. 

I guess I should use this to write about ideas for how I can write a [[Borges]] inspired short story. I wonder if I should start with the themes that he chose to write extensively about.
