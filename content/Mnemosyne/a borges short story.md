I like how in [[Borges]] short stories there's always an element of exploring the effect of supernatural phenomena when it runs up against the limits of human capability.

I guess I should use this to write about ideas for how I can write a [[Borges]] inspired short story. I wonder if I should start with the themes that he chose to write extensively about.
