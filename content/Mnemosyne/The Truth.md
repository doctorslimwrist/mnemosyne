# What We Cannot Know
The human mind has one crucial limitation. It is a [[scanning system]]. It is a linear system of conscious attention that passes over the world in lines. Our vision can take in one and only one point at a time. It has a focus, which is intense, and a periphery, which takes in more abstract information and forms. Together, what we call *vision* is just the sum total of the information contained in the part of [[the universe]] which happens to fall within that cone of eyesight at any given time. 

But the world comes at us extremely quickly, with a flood of information coming in from every sense, in every direction, able to be digested with varying levels of ease. It is this fundamental limitation that gets in the way of our ability to navigate the world. As [[Alan Watts]] puts it, we cannot deal with more than a few variables at once. Computers and technology in general make it so that we can linearly scan *much* quicker, but it's still linear scanning.
