I should probably start this meditation session writing about something that I unfortunately have to spend a lot of my energy and efforts integrating into my life: transformation. 

I think about the [[difficulty of change]] and the [[inherent sadness of disappearing]]. 
[[But why?]] 

I want to make a [[video diary]] type meditation on it.
