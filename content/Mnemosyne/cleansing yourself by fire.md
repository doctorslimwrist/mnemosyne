In order to begin and maintain a successful transition, a person must be willing to die. I mean this. 

The most difficult part of getting over the crushing shame was coming to terms with the risk I knew I'd be taking on. This world is built for certain people, but not for trans women. I knew that chasing my highest self meant putting her in immense danger. When I began transition I felt that the danger was so high I'd never be able to overcome. Now that I'm a year in, I realize I never will, but nevertheless I continue living my life because there is no other option. The river will eventually run into the sea, but it cannot turn back. It cannot return to [[the mountains]].
