# Borges
Borges was an author that I respect immensely for his command of several languages. There is something incredibly gorgeous about how his work reads well in English for one reason, but reads well in Spanish for entirely separate reasons. 

He wrote about [[The Infinite]], flirting with [[religious iconography]] and motifs, adapting them and twisting them and probing them deeply. I sometimes think he drove himself mad.
