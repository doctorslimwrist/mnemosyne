# Finite Capacity, Infinite Input
There is an understandable preoccupation with the the impossible. If it's impossible, how do you even write about it? Does writing about the infinite constitute a successful attempt at handing it? At grappling with it? Surely writing about it counts for at least something.

Grappling with *what is* -- the human attempt at truth-- is one of the core human impulses (what others?) and to formulate a question about [[Look outward. What do you see?]] is to grapple with [[The Infinite]].
